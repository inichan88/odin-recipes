    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 pound) boneless prime rib roast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 carrot, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 small unpeeled onion, quartered and separated</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>The day before serving, remove the roast from the package and dry 
            thoroughly with paper towels. Set roast on a baking sheet, and place in 
            refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator 1 hour before cooking to 
            allow meat to reach room temperature.</li>
        <li>Rub the roast all over with horseradish and Dijon mustard. Mix kosher salt, 
            black pepper, thyme, and garlic powder together in small bowl; sprinkle over 
            the roast.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place celery, carrot, and 
            onion into the bottom of a roasting pan; place the roast on top.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 
            degrees F (175 degrees C), and roast until the meat is browned and an 
            instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast 
            reads 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, transfer roast to a platter, and cover with a tent of 
            aluminum foil. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. The temperature of the meat will 
            rise about 10 degrees during resting time.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
